** used to configure sth in live time
* thinking is important,
However, if can not make it sure while think it is possible, ok, try it.
* insist on no matter what:
recall the lesson : one month just do one thing no matter what
** about time:
*** morning : get up at 7:30 and next to have breakfast
***           morning : think carefully
*** evening : before going to sleep, do a five-minute exercise
***           evening : practice the sth that needs practise
** evening : watch the videos which just broaden one's horizen 
** about the attitude and some principle
*** ever make decision when angry and hungry
*** when hungry, go to eat sth. Do not insit on without meaning
*** the first important step is to finish and use a simple example
* learn newthing:
** make out the others works
** then imiate to write some similar thing
** then expand
** conclusion : learning starts with imitaion
** learning from practice to abstract, and the use abstract to practice
*** finish the loop, is to say update the loop
** to new thing, the best method is repeat and repeat.
** just like move is rest and body training
- looking and thinking is learning
